  ☆ Hey soo before you interact with me, there's a few things you should may know!
  
  ☆ I am perfectly comfortable with my own ponys (I'm not comfortable if your with a pony that with a fandom that I hate/don't like)
  
  ☆ I am not changing my pony, If you say if it too bright/others, Then don't focus on me. 
  
  ☆ Sometime i get scared to interact or contact first. I sometime overthink that if I interact first, they wouldn't reply back because i'm bothering them or annoying them. I do get very scared to approach people or talk to people. I do interact/whisper first when I see a pony that really cool and i think every pony is cool! (I do not want to bother or annoy anyone."
